#The following code finds the mean of a set of numbers.


list = [3,3,5,4,6,8,1,23,4,5,81]      #this makes the list 
list.sort() #so it goes from lowest to highest
print(list) #this prints the list to the reader

#this code figures out the mean
x = sum(list) #the sum function adds up all of the numbers together
y = len(list) #the len function determines how many items are in the list

print("the mean is ", x/y)  #this code prints the sum of all the numbers divided by all the amount of numbers in the list






#The following code finds the median of a list of numbers.




















#The following list finds the mode of a list of numbers.
